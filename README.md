# Analysy

## Why Analysy ?

The idea of this project is to make email checking efficient and easier. So the main point is analysing emails using different NLP techniques so you don't have to read the email in it's entirety, this project presents some NLP features such as :

- Large text summarization this is used to summarize the body of the email;
- Sentimental analysis this is used to prioritize emails as Negative or Positive sentimentally;
- Topic and keywords extraction this is useful to search for emails with certain keywords :)

## This project was generated with these technologies :

### Front end :
`Angular 14`, `Angular Material` & `tailwindcss` for extra styling.
### Back end : 
`Fask` using `Python 3`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `python app.py` in the back end folder for the flask server to run.
